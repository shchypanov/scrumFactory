3) Create a javascript array called “MyArray” containing the values 1,2,3,4,5

4) Write a javascript loop function that will take an array similar to the one described in the previous function as a parameter and print the value at each index of the array (ie MyArray[0], MyArray[1], etc)

5) Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
